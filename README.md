# TommorowsTechToday

Tommorow's Tech Today is a BattleTech Flashpoint that intentionally breaks from canon with the tech it gives you as a reward.

Currently in extreme Alpha state.

Working features:

-Advanced weaponry

-Heat Sink Converter - Argo upgrade that automatically converts single heat sinks into same sized Double Heat Sink (DHS) equivalents

-First mission of the included Flashpoint

Currently bugged:
-Second flashpoint conversation (user cannot transition to Argo drop bay for mission, mission does not spawn after Flashpoint decision)

Untested:
-All missions past second conversation

-Flashpoint specific events

-Advanced Gear

Any and all bug fixing help appreciated.
